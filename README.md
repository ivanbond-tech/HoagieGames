A python simulation script to simulate a "Hunger Games" style battle for every neighborhood in Pittsburgh to determine a winner. Data pulled from WRPDC and more information found in info/rules.txt

TODO:
- [x] Movement
- [x] Player and map generation
- [x] Attributes and rules
- [x] Command line arguments
- [ ] Data analysis (still missing information about neighborhood schools, clubs, churches, etc.)
- [ ] Determine player attributes based on data from analysis
