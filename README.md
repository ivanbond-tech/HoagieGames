# Hoagie Games

A python simulation script to simulate a "Hunger Games" style battle for every neighborhood in Pittsburgh to determine a winner. Data pulled from WRPDC and more information found in info/rules.txt. This simulation was made for a final project for CMPINF0010 Big Ideas in Computing and Information.

## TODO:
- [x] Movement
- [x] Player and map generation
- [x] Attributes and rules
- [x] Command line arguments
- [ ] Data analysis (still missing information about neighborhood schools, clubs, churches, etc.)
- [ ] Determine player attributes based on data from analysis
- [ ] Attacking - player with higher attributes wins
- [ ] Simulation - currently just picks random neighborhood as winner
- [ ] Run statistical tests to determine if result is conclusive

## Setup
- <code>pip3 install pandas</code>
- <code>pip3 install numpy</code>

## How to Run
<code>python3 run_sim.py</code>
