Game Logic 

[ ] Movement/Attacking:
    - Determine leader of allies (highest attribute values)
    - Leader makes all inital movement decisions
    - Order allies around leader's 3x3 (or open positions if on edge of map)
    - When leader moves, move allies in same relative order around leader
    - If ally/leader steps on special map pos (not 0), go in order based off first player to step on special pos
    - If allies/leader move into an enemy's 3x3 (or surrounding pos) initiate attack
        - For attack, compare both leader's attribute values
        - The leader with higher attribute values wins
        - Losing team all dies, resetting map values to 0
